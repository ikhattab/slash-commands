# Refactor Code

Refactor the selected code to improve:

1. Readability: Clear naming, logical structure
2. Maintainability: DRY principles, single responsibility
3. Performance: Remove unnecessary operations (only if no behavior change)
4. Modern patterns: Use current language features and idioms

Rules:
- Do not change external behavior or API
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Add brief comments for complex logic if helpful

Show the refactored code and explain the key changes made.
