# Visualize Code

Use mermaid diagram to visualize the data lineage of the referenced code or project.

When analyzing code, create diagrams that show:

- Data flow between components
- Dependencies and relationships
- Function call hierarchies
- State transformations
- Architecture overview when relevant

Output the diagram using mermaid syntax that can be rendered in markdown.
