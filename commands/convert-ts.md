# Convert to TypeScript

Convert the selected JavaScript code to TypeScript:

1. Add type annotations: parameters, return types, variables
2. Create interfaces for object shapes and API responses
3. Use generics where appropriate for reusability
4. Handle nullability with proper types

Guidelines:
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects
- Use strict-mode-friendly types (no implicit any)
- Add type guards where needed for narrowing
- Export types that might be used elsewhere

Show the converted code with all types added.
