# Write Tests

Write comprehensive tests for the selected code. Include:

1. Unit tests: Test individual functions in isolation
2. Edge cases: Empty inputs, null values, boundary conditions
3. Error cases: Test error handling and exceptions
4. Integration tests: If applicable, test component interactions

Guidelines:
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for high coverage of logic branches

Match the testing framework and style already used in this codebase.
